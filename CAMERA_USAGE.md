## How to Position the Album Cover

When taking a photo of an album cover, follow these guidelines for best results:

### Positioning

1. **Center the album in the square guide**

   - The app shows a white square in the center of the preview
   - Position your album cover so it fits within this square
   - The square is sized to match typical album cover dimensions

2. **Fill the frame**

   - Try to fill as much of the square as possible with the album cover
   - Leave a small border around the edges (don't crop the cover)
   - Make sure the entire cover is visible

3. **Keep it flat and straight**
   - Hold the album flat (not at an angle)
   - Align the edges of the album with the square guide
   - Avoid perspective distortion (looking at it from the side)

### Lighting

- **Good lighting is essential**
  - Use natural light when possible
  - Avoid harsh shadows across the cover
  - Make sure text and images are clearly visible
  - Avoid glare/reflections on glossy covers

### Distance

- **Optimal distance**
  - Hold the iPad about 12-18 inches from the album
  - Far enough that the entire cover fits in the square
  - Close enough that text is readable

### Tips for Best Results

1. **Text recognition (OCR)**

   - Works best when album title and artist name are clearly visible
   - Ensure text is in focus and well-lit
   - Avoid covers with decorative/fancy fonts if possible

2. **Image matching**

   - Works best when the entire cover is visible
   - Avoid partial covers or covers with hands/fingers in frame
   - Make sure the cover matches what's in your Discogs collection

3. **Common issues**
   - **Blurry images**: Hold the iPad steady, wait for autofocus
   - **Too dark**: Move to better lighting or use a lamp
   - **Glare**: Change angle to avoid reflections
   - **Not recognized**: Try again with better lighting or different angle

### Visual Guides

The camera preview shows:

- **Corner brackets**: Help you align the frame
- **Center square**: Where to position the album cover
- **Inner border**: For precise positioning

### Step-by-Step Process

1. Click "Start Camera"
2. Position the album cover in the center square
3. Wait for the camera to focus (you'll see it adjust)
4. Make sure the cover is:
   - Centered in the square
   - Fully visible
   - Well-lit
   - In focus
5. Click "Capture & Scrobble"
6. Wait for processing (usually 2-5 seconds)
7. The app will either:
   - Match via image recognition (if database has hashes)
   - Extract text and search your collection
   - Show an error if it can't identify the album

### Troubleshooting

**"No text found in image"**

- Improve lighting
- Make sure text is clearly visible
- Try a different angle
- Ensure the cover is in focus

**"Album not found in collection"**

- Make sure the album is in your Discogs collection
- Try again - OCR might have misread the text
- Check that artist/album names match exactly

**"Could not identify artist and album"**

- The text extraction didn't work
- Try with better lighting
- Make sure the cover is flat and straight
- Ensure text is clearly visible

### Best Practices

- **Take your time**: Don't rush the photo
- **Check focus**: Wait for the camera to focus before capturing
- **Good lighting**: This is the most important factor
- **Steady hands**: Hold the iPad steady to avoid blur
- **Full cover**: Make sure the entire cover is visible

The app is designed to be forgiving - you don't need perfect positioning, but following these guidelines will give you the best results!
